# üèó Scaffold-ETH 2 with Nillion

This template has all the power of the Scaffold-ETH 2 dapp toolkit with a Nillion integration so that you can store, retrieve, and run blind computation on secrets stored in Nillion.

## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v18.17)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

To use Scaffold-ETH 2 with Nillion, you need to store your user key in MetaMask Snaps

1. Install the [MetaMask Flask browser extension](https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/install-flask/) that will let you work with experimental snaps

2. [Visit the Nillion Key Management UI](https://nillion-snap-site.vercel.app/) to generate a user key and store it in MetaMask Snaps - this saves your user key within MetaMask so it can be used by other Nillion web apps

3. Run through this quickstart and "Connect to Snap" from the UI

## Quickstart

To get started with Scaffold-ETH 2, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repo & install dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/NillionNetwork/scaffold-eth-with-nillion.git
cd scaffold-eth-with-nillion
```

Installation steps

Complete these temporary install steps to install the private @nillion/nillion-client-js-browser package

Remove the @nillion/nillion-client-js-browser package

```
yarn remove @nillion/nillion-client-js-browser
```

Reinstall @nillion/nillion-client-js-browser with your NPM_TOKEN

```
NPM_TOKEN=your_npm_token npm i @nillion/nillion-client-js-browser
```

Then install the rest of the dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

3. Run a local ethereum network in the first terminal:

```
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Hardhat. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `hardhat.config.ts`.

4. On a second terminal, deploy the test ethereum contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/hardhat/contracts` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/hardhat/deploy` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

5. On a third terminal, run a Nillion local network cluster. This bootstraps a Nillion local network of nodes and adds cluster info to your NextJS app .env file

```
yarn run-local-cluster
```

6. On a fourth terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.

Run smart contract test with `yarn hardhat:test`

- Edit your smart contract `YourContract.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`
- Edit your frontend in `packages/nextjs/pages`
- Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`

7. Visit the Nillion Blind Computation demo page and try the working demo

- Visit the Nillion Blind Computation page to try out Blind Computation: `http://localhost:3000/nillion-compute`
- Optinally edit the code for this page in `packages/nextjs/app/nillion-compute/page.tsx`

8. Complete the TODOs in the Hello World page to hook up a working Nillion store and retrieve example

- Visit the Nillion Hello World page: `http://localhost:3000/nillion-hello-world`
- Notice that the buttons and functionality for this page are not hooked up yet.
- Edit the code for this page in `packages/nextjs/app/nillion-hello-world/page.tsx` to complete each of the üéØ TODOs to get the page working
- Need a hint on how to get something working? Take a look at the completed `packages/nextjs/nillion-hello-world/page-complete.tsx` page
